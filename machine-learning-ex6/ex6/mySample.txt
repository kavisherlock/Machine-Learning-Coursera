Hi,

I'm writing to let you know about some major updates to your Kairos Face Recognition API account.

There is no better time to invest in Facial Recognition Technology than now.

Thanks to the arbitrary timelines this cruel business world places on yours truly, we will be offering our services at significantly reduced prices before the end of the year.

What can Kairosâ€™ services help you accomplish?
Discover how your customers feel about your store, film, sales process, or favorite politician by reading the subtle emotional reactions on their face.
Identify and permit customers to enter theme parks, stadiums, cruise lines, or Bruno Mars concerts.
Manage digital content based on the faces in that content.
Setting up free access to our API will take less than 2 minutes -- just hit reply, and lemme know how that sounds.

Thanks,
Max
