This are my solution to Stanford's course for Machine Learning on coursera.org taught by Andrew Ng
I should repeat: MY solutions. Not to be used by anyone else. I use this repo just to keep track of them
And seriously, if you need to use my solutions, you're missing the point of the course
The excersises are for you to get a more hands-on understanding of the machine learning algorithms discussed in the course.
Do them! They really help make everything clear that you may have been confused about in the lecture. Learning by doing.

Plus, it's a MOOC that thousands complete. I doubt a 100% grade is that impressive. Don't bother cheating.
